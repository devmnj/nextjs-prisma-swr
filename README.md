This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# About

This is a Nextjs/React + Prisma ORM example using **SWR** module for data caching. SWR allow us to fast loading data in components and they are amazingly fast and will reuse the cache data

## Modules used
* Nextjs-cors
* [Prisma]([''](https://www.prisma.io/))
* Sqlite
* [Vercel-SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started)

Hope this project will help you.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

 run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/users](http://localhost:3000/api/users). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/users.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
